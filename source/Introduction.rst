`TradingView <https://www.tradingview.com/>`__ has designed its own scripting language called
**Pine Script**.
It allows users to create custom indicators and run them
on our servers. Pine was designed as a lightweight
language focused on the specific task of developing indicators and strategies. Most of TradingView's
built-in indicators have been coded in Pine. It is our
explicit goal to keep Pine accessible and easy to understand for the broadest
possible audience.

Pine is cloud-based and therefore
different in nature to client-side programming languages.
While we will not develop Pine into a full-fledged language with high-end
coding capabilities for building very complex tools, constantly improving
Pine is one of our highest priorities and we are happy to consider any
requests for new features.

Because each script uses computational resources in the cloud, we must
impose limits in order to share these resources fairly among our users.
We strive to impose as few limits as possible while enforcing as many as
needed. We must ensure the platform keeps running smoothly so nobody is
negatively affected by scripts that consume a
disproportionate amount of resources. The imposed limits apply to elements
such as the amount of data from additional symbols, execution time,
memory usage and script size. Additionally, we keep Pine syntax and
semantics simple so it can handle common tasks efficiently.

We will continue to improve Pine's documentation and
support to ensure that anyone who wishes to learn and use Pine may do so,
as this helps grow the Pine development community and provides TradingView users
with more robust and helpful tools.
