Description
-----------

On TradingView it's possible to use pre-built indicators and write
custom ones using Pine Script. Users who write their own scripts can publish them to the 
*Public Library*. You can search the
library for needed scripts before writing one. You can also ask users
who publish scripts for help by sending them a private message (PM) on
TradingView.

Public Library is the storage of all user-published scripts. All
published scripts can be viewed on the `SCRIPTS <https://www.tradingview.com/script/>`__ page, 
or in the *Indicators* |rarr| *Public Library* tab: 

|Public_Library_tab|


Copying a script from Public to Personal Library
------------------------------------------------

To copy a script choose one of two methods:

#. Click the star next to the needed script in the Indicators window: |Add_to_Personal_Library|

#. Open the needed script on the `SCRIPTS <https://www.tradingview.com/script/>`__ page 
   and click the *Add to Favorite Scripts* button: |Add_to_Personal_Library_2|

The script will be added to your Favorites section in the Indicators
window, where you can easily find it when needed: 

|Favorites_section|

 
Scripts in the *Indicators* window are sorted by popularity: the more
users have favorited the script, the higher it will be displayed in
the *Indicators* window:

 |Sorted_by_popularity|


Editing a script from Public Library
------------------------------------

To edit a script from Public Library:

#. Open the script (the script will be unavailable for editing and
   will be colored lighter than normal): |Open_the_script|

#. Click on the *Save As...* button, enter the desired name and save a copy to your
   personal library: |Save_as|


A saved copy of the script will appear in the list of your scripts in
the *Indicators* |rarr| *My Scripts* tab: |My_Scripts|

Now you can open and edit the script.

If the same script is published more than once, a notification on older
versions will appear that a new version is available.


Searching for a script
----------------------

To search for a script, use the *Search* field in the *Indicators* dialog:

|Search_field|

This will search both your Personal and Public Library at the same time:
